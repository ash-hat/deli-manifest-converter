# manifestation
An application that updates Deli v0.2 manifests to v0.3, including commonly used loaders such as TakeAndHoldTweaker. May be expanded upon for further Deli releases.  
Not in the Deli-Collective organization because it is very hacky.

## How to Use It
Drag the manifest file onto the executable. The converted manifest file will be available in the `out` directory, with the mod GUID as its name. Remember that the converted manifest file needs to be named `manifest.json` to be used in a mod.
