# manifestation
An application that updates [Deli](https://github.com/Deli-Collective/Deli) v0.2 manifests to v0.3, including commonly used loaders such as [TakeAndHoldTweaker](https://github.com/devyndamonster/TakeAndHoldTweaker). May be expanded upon for further Deli releases.  
This is not in [the Deli organization](https://github.com/Deli-Collective) because it is very hacky.

## How to Use It
Drag the manifest file onto the executable. The converted manifest file will be available in the `out` directory, with the mod GUID as its name. Remember that the converted manifest file needs to be named `manifest.json` to be used in a mod.
